This code is part of the SONOPA Project (http://www.sonopa.eu/). SOcial Networks for Older adults to Promote an Active Life (SONOPA) will employ a set of available ICT technologies to develop an end-to-end solution for stimulating and supporting activities at home. SONOPA will achieve its objective through a data collection and fusion structure which merges real measurements of the user’s activities in order to encourage activities with their peers. Reminders and recommendations come through personalized easy-to-use wall displays placed at the user’s home.
